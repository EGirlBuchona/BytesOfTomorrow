Description:
In this update, authentication and authorization systems were implemented for the API. Users can now register and log in using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage access permissions.

Changes made:
- Implementation of Marshmallow for data validation.
- Postman tests to validate data and authentication.
- Code updates to include validation in endpoints related to task creation and editing.
